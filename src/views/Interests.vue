          <p>My interests vary but I always try to keep myself busy throughout
            the day with tasks that can be either be
            relaxing or beneficial to a skill I am trying to
            develop. Some of my favorite things to do include watching Youtube videos
            in the background with a cup of coffee and chilling with my cats.
            I also like to try and improve my excel skills or find new
            ways of completing a task faster at work.
            The more time I save at work, the more time I have to focus on other items.
            I also feel like a lot of stress is taken off my
            shoulders when I find a new fast way of doing something.

      <p>Many people I know graduated college without having any
                idea what they enjoy or what
                position they would land in. Some people took
                positions completely outside
                of their major and changed career paths completely.
